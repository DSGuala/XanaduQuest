# XanaduQuest
Q1 Hackathon

## A small dungeon crawling game with "quantum" concepts.

### Instructions:

- Explore the dungeon, press switches to change the chances of receiving treasure or meeting monsters.
- During battles your state collapses to "alive" or "dead" when the measurement timer runs out. Same goes for the enemies.
- Pick up the  golden logic gates that appear to affect the enemy's state.
- Avoid the red logic gates to keep the enemy from changing your state.

### Good luck!
